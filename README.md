## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Make (optional, for using Makefile commands)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- GCP account (optional, for cloud deployment)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshbarros/golang-carflow-api.git
   cd golang-carflow-api
   ```

2. Build and run the service:
   ```bash
   make build
   make run
   ```

   Or without Make:
   ```bash
   go build -o carflow ./cmd
   ./carflow
   ```

3. The service will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Using the CLI

CarFlow comes with a command-line interface for easy interaction with the API:

1. Build the CLI:
   ```bash
   make build-cli
   ```

2. Run CLI commands:
   ```bash
   # Show all commands
   ./carflow-cli help
   
   # List all cars
   ./carflow-cli list
   
   # Get a specific car
   ./carflow-cli get -id "1"
   
   # Create a new car
   ./carflow-cli create -make "Toyota" -model "Supra" -year 2022 -color "red"
   
   # Update a car
   ./carflow-cli update -id "1" -color "blue"
   
   # Delete a car
   ./carflow-cli delete -id "1"
   
   # Check API health
   ./carflow-cli health
   ```

### Using the Web UI

CarFlow also includes a web-based user interface:

1. Build the UI:
   ```bash
   make build-ui
   ```

2. Run the UI:
   ```bash
   make run-ui
   ```

3. Access the UI in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## üì¶ API Examples

### Create a car
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/cars \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"make":"Tesla","model":"Model 3","year":2022,"color":"red"}'
```

### Get all cars
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/cars
```

### Get a specific car
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/cars/{id}
```

### Update a car
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/cars/{id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"make":"Tesla","model":"Model 3","year":2023,"color":"blue"}'
```

### Filter and Sort
```bash
# Filter by make and sort by year descending
curl "http://localhost:8080/cars?make=Tesla&sort=year&order=desc"
```

### Pagination
```bash
# Get page 2 with 5 items per page
curl "http://localhost:8080/cars?page=2&page_size=5"
```

## üß™ Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
make test
```

Or without Make:
```bash
go test ./... -v
```

Run benchmarks with:
```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./test
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Options

There are several ways to deploy the CarFlow API:

### Local Deployment

Run the application on your local machine:
```bash
go build -o carflow ./cmd
./carflow
```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t carflow:latest .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 carflow:latest
   ```

### GCP Free Tier Deployment

You can deploy the API to Google Cloud Run using the free tier:

1. Set up GCP project with spending controls:
   ```bash
   # Create a new GCP project
   gcloud projects create carflow-api-project --name="CarFlow API"
   
   # Link billing account (required, but set spending limit to $0)
   gcloud billing projects link carflow-api-project --billing-account=YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
   ```

2. Enable required APIs and create resources:
   ```bash
   # Enable APIs
   gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com
   
   # Create Docker repository
   gcloud artifacts repositories create carflow-repo \
     --repository-format=docker \
     --location=us-central1
   ```

3. Deploy using Cloud Build:
   ```bash
   # Trigger build and deployment
   gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml
   ```

The Cloud Run service will auto-scale to zero when not in use, helping you stay within free tier limits. For detailed instructions, see [GCP Free Tier Deployment Guide](docs/gcp-free-deployment.md).

### GitHub Pages for UI

You can deploy the web UI component to GitHub Pages:
```bash
# Create a gh-pages branch
git checkout -b gh-pages

# Build the UI
go build -o carflow-ui ./cmd/ui

# Copy UI assets to root
cp -r cmd/ui/templates/* .

# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin gh-pages
```

## üîÑ CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow runs on every push and pull request to the main branch:
- Lints the code with golangci-lint
- Runs unit and integration tests
- Reports code coverage

### GCP Deployment with Cloud Build

Cloud Build can be configured to automatically deploy changes when you push to the main branch:

1. Connect GitHub repository to Cloud Build
2. Configure trigger to watch the main branch
3. Use the provided `cloudbuild.yaml` for deployment configuration
